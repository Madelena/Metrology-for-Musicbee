Feel free to redistribute and the only thing I ask is to give proper credits back to me. That would help my livelihood since design is my job.

## How to Install

### Method A: Install using MusicBee
![Method A Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/DQd2vOL.png)
Remember to add the XML file as a Theater Mode, not a Skin! Look for the right menu item marked under View > Theater Mode. If you do the latter, your MusicBee will crash hard.

### Method B: Install by copying files in Explorer

Find the folder where you installed MusicBee, which is usually under C:\Program Files (x86)\MusicBee\. Go to the Plugins folder and you will find two TheaterMode folders.

If you want to use the Theater Mode in a tab in the main window as a Now Playing view, or if you want to use it in Compact View, copy the xml file to TheaterMode.Embeded.

If you want to use the Theater Mode as a full screen window or its own window, copy the xml file to TheaterMode.List.

## System Requirements
* MusicBee 3.x
* Windows 10 with the Segoe MDL2 Assets font. Without it all the icons won't work. If you aren't on Windows 10 1903 or later, download the font here: https://aka.ms/SegoeFonts
