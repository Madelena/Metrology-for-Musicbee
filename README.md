## How to Install

### Method A: Install using MusicBee
![Method A Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/DQd2vOL.png)
Remember to add the XML file as a Theater Mode, not a Skin! Look for the right menu item marked under View > Theater Mode. If you do the latter, your MusicBee will crash hard.

### Method B: Install by copying files in Explorer

Find the folder where you installed MusicBee, which is usually under C:\Program Files (x86)\MusicBee\. Go to the Plugins folder and you will find two TheaterMode folders.

If you want to use the Theater Mode in a tab in the main window as a Now Playing view, or if you want to use it in Compact View, copy the xml file to TheaterMode.Embeded.

If you want to use the Theater Mode as a full screen window or its own window, copy the xml file to TheaterMode.List.

## System Requirements
* MusicBee 3.x
* Windows 10 with the Segoe MDL2 Assets font. Without it all the icons won't work. If you aren't on Windows 10 1903 or later, download the font here: https://aka.ms/SegoeFonts

## Credits
Please feel free to redistribute and the only thing I ask is to give proper credits back to me. That would help my livelihood since design is my job.

The initial code was partially based on the Rdio Theater Mode view.
