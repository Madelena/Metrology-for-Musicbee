# Extras for MusicBee

## Dark Kandinsky Mod skin

Lots of folks had asked me about what skin I used in my screenshots. It's a modified version of Kandinsky Dark Mod, and since it's too similar to the original, I did not make it into an official release.

To install it, simply copy the xml file to your MusicBee\skins\Dark-Metro Series\ folder.

## MusicBee Settings

Some of you also wondered how I made the Artist / Albums / Tracks tabs. They are all Music tabs, but with different layouts, i.e. Artists layout, Album Covers layout, and then Album and Tracks layout.

If you want to apply these settings in a quick and lazy way, you can also download my MusicBee Settings.ini file and apply it using the Load Settings Snapshot function under Edit \ Saved Settings in the main menu.
